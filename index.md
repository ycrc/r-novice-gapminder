*an introduction to R for non-programmers using gapminder data*

The goal of this lesson is to give novice programmers a foundation in the fundamentals of R for data analysis.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the
programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files.
> Files are organised in directories (folders).
> Know how to access files not in the working directory by specifying the path.
