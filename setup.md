There are several options for you as you follow along with this workshop:
* Simply watch as we run commands in RStudio (easiest)
* Run RStudio in the cloud, using binder (easy) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ycrc/r-novice-gapminder/binder?urlpath=rstudio) 
* Install R and R Studio yourself on your computer (harder)

To install R and RStudio:

The latest version of R can be downloaded [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

RStudio is an application (an integrated development environment or IDE) that facilitates the use of R and offers a number of nice additional features.
It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You will need the free Desktop version for your computer.
